# Savings-Account-Interest-Calculator

This repository contains a web application built with Flask and JavaScript. Its purpose is to calculate and visualize interest earned on savings accounts. The application fetches current top interest rates from www.highinterestsavings.ca/, enabling users to compare their current interest rates with those available at other financial institutions. Additionally, users can project their earnings over time using interactive charts.
